# Basics
## Aim 
Write a basic hello world program and calculator program in C++
## Theory 
The "Hello, World!" program is to showcase the basic structure of a C++ program, including the use of headers, namespaces, the main function, and console output with 'std::cout'.
<br/>The Calculator program takes two integer inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It then displays the results of these operations. This familiarizes learners with syntax, output, the main function, incorporating variables, user input, and basic arithmetic operations. 
</br>The key concepts illustrated in each program are

</br>**1. Basic Structure of a C++ Program**
</br>All three programs showcase the essential structure of a C++ program, which includes:
- **Header Files:** Using #include <iostream> to include the standard input-output stream library.
- **Namespace Declaration:** Using using namespace std; to simplify access to standard library functions and objects.

</br>**2. The Main Function**
</br>Each program contains the main() function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It demonstrates how to define a function in C++ and emphasizes that every program must have a main function.

</br>**3. Input and Output Operations**
- **Input Operations:**
The arithmetic program and the variable input program utilize cin to receive user input for different data types, demonstrating how to gather information from the user.
- **Output Operations:**
The cout object is used in all three programs to display messages and values on the console, showcasing formatted output with the use of endl for line breaks.

</br>**4. Variable Declaration and Data Types**
</br>The variable input program introduces the declaration of different variable types (integer, character, and float), illustrating how to store different kinds of data. This helps in understanding Data Types: Recognizing the basic data types in C++ (int, char, and float) and their purpose in storing various types of information.

</br>**5. Basic Arithmetic Operations**
</br>The arithmetic program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This introduces:
- **Operators:** Understanding arithmetic operators and how to manipulate numerical data.
- **Type Casting:** In the arithmetic program, the need for type casting (e.g., converting int to float for accurate division) is introduced.

</br>**6. Program Flow and Logic**
</br>Each program showcases the flow of execution, starting from the main() function, leading to user prompts, and ending with outputs. This reinforces:
- **Control Flow:** Understanding how the sequence of execution works in a program.
- **Logic:** Encouraging logical thinking about how to structure a program and handle data.

</br>**7. Formatting Output**
</br>The way outputs are presented using cout with clear labels and formatting (like new lines) emphasizes the importance of user-friendly interfaces in programming.

</br>**8. Comments in Code**
</br>Each program includes comments, demonstrating how to use comments to document code, which is crucial for readability and maintenance.
